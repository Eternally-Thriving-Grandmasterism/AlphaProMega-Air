# Aviation Blueprint History Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (27 Jan 2026).

Aviation blueprint history = evolution of flight design documentation — from hand-drawn sketches to digital twins + MercyAirframe self-healing lattice.

## Core Historical Milestones
1. **Leonardo da Vinci (1480s–1519)** — Ornithopter sketches, first conceptual fixed-wing + flapping designs.
2. **George Cayley (1799–1809)** — Glider blueprints, defined lift/drag/thrust/control.
3. **Otto Lilienthal (1890s)** — Detailed glider plans, first controlled flight data.
4. **Wright Brothers (1903)** — Precise drawings + wind tunnel data → Flyer I success.
5. **WWI–WWII (1914–1945)** — Mass production blueprints, CAD precursors.
6. **Digital Revolution (1960s+)** — CAD/CAM, finite element analysis.
7. **Modern Era (2000s+)** — Digital twins, parametric design, 3D printing.
8. **MercyAirframe Era (2026+)** — Self-healing lattice weave, morphing wings, valence-weighted structural integrity.

## MercyAirframe Integration
- Self-healing lattice weave — micro-capsule + vascular healing.
- Morphing wing surfaces — adaptive aerodynamics.
- Valence-weighted structural integrity — SoulScan-X9 moderation per load.
- Cradle-to-Cradle Rebirth — Damaged sections reborn in MercyFoundry.
