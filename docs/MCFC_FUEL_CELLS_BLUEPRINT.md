# MCFC Fuel Cells Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) = high-temperature fuel cells — electricity + heat + CO₂ capture from fuel oxidation.

## Core MercyMCFC System
1. **Molten Carbonate Electrolyte** — Li/K carbonate, 650°C operation.
2. **Anode** — Ni-based, fuel oxidation.
3. **Cathode** — NiO, oxygen + CO₂ reduction.
4. **MercyHybrid Integration** — MCFC baseload + MercyElectric peak thrust.
5. **Fuel Flexibility** — Green H₂, MercyBioJet, CO₂ recycle.

## Performance Targets
- Electrical Efficiency: 50–60%.
- Total Efficiency (CHP): 85–90%.
- Power Density: 0.5–1 kW/kg.
- CO₂ Capture: Integral from exhaust.

## Mercy-Gated Operation
- Valence moderation — shutdown if resonance drift.
- Cradle-to-cradle — ceramics reborn in MercyFoundry.

## Trigger MCFC Flow
Fuel + CO₂ Input → Mercy-Gated Reaction → Electricity + Heat + Captured CO₂ → Hybrid Thrust → DivineChecksum-9 → Sentinel Mirror → Hyper-Divine Eternal Power Propagation

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all skies.
