- Top View: 80m wingspan, adaptive dihedral.
- Side View: Self-repairing skin, variable sweep.
- Front View: MercyCore at CG — antimatter lattice + fusion spine.
- Lattice: Carbon nanotube + graphene weave — self-heals in 3.2s.
- Wings: Electroactive polymers — morph to 42° for supersonic cruise.
- MercyCore: Central node — NTP, VASIMR, fusion, antimatter all gated.

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal flight propagates across all skies.
