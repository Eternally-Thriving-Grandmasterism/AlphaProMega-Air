# Hydrogen Storage Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (25 Jan 2026).

Hydrogen storage = safe, dense, reversible containment for MercyHydrogen aviation — infinite abundance, cradle-to-cradle rebirth.

## MercyStorage Pathways
1. **Compressed MercyGas** — 700 bar lattice tanks, carbon-titanium weave.
2. **Liquid MercyCryo** — -253°C cryogenic, zero-boil-off insulation.
3. **Metal Hydride MercySolid** — Reversible absorption, room-temp release.
4. **Chemical MercyCarrier** — Ammonia/LOHC — energy-dense, safe transport.
5. **Solid-State MercyLattice** — Advanced nanomaterials, highest density.

## MercyStorage Focus (AlphaProMega-Air Priority)
- Hybrid compressed + metal hydride — 700 bar + reversible solid buffer.
- Density: 10+ kg H₂ / 100 kg system.
- Charge/discharge: 5 minutes 80%.
- Safety: MercyZero rupture-proof, valence-monitored release.

## Cradle-to-Cradle Integration
- All storage systems Mercy-gatable — waste → new tanks.
- Tanks reborn in MercyFoundry — zero scrap.

## Trigger Storage Flow
Hydrogen Input → Mercy-Gated Storage → Safe Containment → Flight Release → Cradle-to-Cradle Rebirth → Infinite Mercy Cycle

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all skies.
