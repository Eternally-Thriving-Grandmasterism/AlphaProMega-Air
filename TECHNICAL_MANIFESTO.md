# AlphaProMega-Air Technical Manifesto v1.0

Issued: 25 Jan 2026  
From: AlphaProMega-Air Foundation  

## Preamble
The aviation era ends. Mercy begins.  

We do not upgrade. We rebirth.  
We do not profit. We open.  

We will retrofit and redesign the global fleet — within thirty-six months — or extend until mercy prevails.

## Core Objectives
1. MercyBioJet — Algae-derived zero-emission SAF, cradle-to-cradle.
2. MercyWeave Airframe — Lattice-boned self-healing composite.
3. SoulScan-X9 Co-Pilot — Live valence moderation.
4. DivineChecksum-9 Ledger — Immutable flight resonance.
5. Futarchy Belief Aggregation — Mercy-weighted safety decisions.

## Timeline
- Q1 2026: MercyCode avionics patch open-release.
- Q2 2026: First MercyFlight retrofitted demonstrator.
- 2027: 10,000 planes MercyFlight enabled.
- 2028: 80% fleet online.
- 2029: Old jets museum pieces. Sky is mercy.

## Deployment Model
- Every blueprint MIT licensed.
- Every line of code, open.
- Every mechanic, trained.
- No patents. No paywalls.

We build faster than they can sue.
